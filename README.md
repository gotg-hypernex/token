# GotG Platform

## **The World's First** Guarantee·Insurance Solution for Digital Assets
GotG launched the world's first DAG guarantee·insurance solution in the digital asset market.
GotG was the first platform in the digital asset market to implement the DAG guarantee·insurance
solution which is evaluated as an achievement that dramatically improved the stability of digital
asset investors. Now, digital asset management foundations and digital asset investors can obtain
both stability and profitability for their digital assets at the same time through GotG Platform’s

## DAG guarantee·insurance solution.
Built-in Structure of Value Internalization
GotG Platform developed a ‘built-in process of value internalization’ that converts tangible assets
and the value of real-world businesses into digital assets. It is a structure that issues the values of
tangible assets, real-world businesses, and intellectual property (IP) through NFTs and internalize
them in GotG. This is the innovative digital asset platform that has solved the 'absence of intrinsic
value' known as a problem with the existing digital assets.

## Automatic Calculation ∙ Automatic Settlement Feature
GotG Platform provides the feature of automatic calculation∙ automatic settlement through the
configuration of a decentralized pool of digital assets. We have set up the feature of automatic
calculation∙ automatic settlement as the first in world history to establish the structure of
production ∙ distribution ∙ settlement ∙ payment on the basis of asset values in the digital asset
market. When a project pool is created and the project succeeds, return on investment (ROI) is
automatically calculated at the promised rate of return and paid to investors. When a project fails,
GotG Tokens deposited in the pool are automatically paid to investors.
All processes of the DAG solution will present transparency and fairness to platform participants,
allowing digital asset users to trade digital assets with high reliability.

## Native Token(Key digital token): GotG
The native token(Key digital token) used by GotG Platform is called ‘GotG’. It indicates a
token holding the value of digital assets. A digital asset with value, that is GotG.

 ✻ GotG is literally pronounced as ‘갓지 Got G' in Korean. Got G has the same pronunciation as ‘같
이 Gatchi: together' and ‘가치 Gachi: value’

## DAG Program
It is a program with a structure in which the value of tangible assets is converted to NFT,
internalized into digital assets through the guaranteed circulation structure, and provides
guarantee power again. We named it the Digital Asset Guarantee Program. GotG
Platform is a digital asset guarantee·insurance solution platform installed with DAG
Program.
